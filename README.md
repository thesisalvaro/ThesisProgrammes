# ThesisProgrammes
This Thesis has been organized in three chapters. There are three folders, each one containing the programmes used for the figures in their respective chapters, separated in two folders. 
-"Experimental" folders. These are (often) incomplete programmes, with ideas, tryouts and several information that was not used in the end.
-"Final" folders. These contain the actual used programmes, with instructions on how to obtain the figures in the thesis. Many require commenting and uncommenting several parts of the programme to obtain one figure or other.
